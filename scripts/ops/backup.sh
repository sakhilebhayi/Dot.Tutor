# Writes to $BACKUP_DIR (default ~/dot-tutor-backups, mode 700):
#   db-<UTC>.dump          PostgreSQL: pg_dump custom format, checked with pg_restore --list
#   db-<UTC>.sqlite        SQLite: an online backup (consistent while the site writes), checked with PRAGMA integrity_check
#   files-<UTC>.tar.gz     storage/app/private: lesson files, course and library files, message attachments, screening
#                          evidence, tutor photos and qualification evidence, checked with tar -t
#   *.sha256               a checksum beside each file
# and keeps the newest N (default 14, or $BACKUP_KEEP) of each kind. Reads DB_* from <app>/.env; no secret is printed.
# Exit 0 only when every file written was verified; any failure prints the cause on stderr and exits non-zero (the last
# line of storage/logs/backup.log is the alarm).
#
# Not covered: .env and APP_KEY (keep a copy OFF the host: without the key, sessions, hidden message originals and
# two-factor secrets cannot be decrypted, and nobody stays signed in), the code (git), the build (rebuilt by the
# deploy). It does not leave the hosting account unless BACKUP_OFFSITE is set to an rsync destination (user@host:path).
#
# Cron (install it by hand, docs/R47_OPERATIONS.md section 2; the deploy does NOT manage this line, and its marker must
# not contain "# dot-tutor", which the deploy's crontab step owns):
